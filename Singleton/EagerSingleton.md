## Eager Initialization

### Explanation
Eager Initialization is one of the ways to implement the Singleton pattern. In this approach, the instance of the Singleton class is created when the class is loaded into memory, regardless of whether it is immediately needed or not. It ensures that the instance is always available for use but can lead to resource wastage if the instance is not always needed.

### Implementation

```java
public class EagerSingleton {
    // 1. Private static instance created during class loading.
    private static final EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();

    // 2. Private constructor prevents external instantiation.
    private EagerSingleton() {
        // Initialization code, if any.
    }

    // 3. Public method to provide access to the instance.
    public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Code Example and Explanation

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `private static final EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();`: This line declares a private static final instance variable called `instance` and initializes it with a new instance of the `EagerSingleton` class. This instance is created during the class loading process, ensuring its availability.

2. `private EagerSingleton() { /* Initialization code, if any. */ }`: This is the private constructor of the `EagerSingleton` class. It prevents external classes from creating new instances of `EagerSingleton`. You can include initialization code inside this constructor if needed.

3. `public static EagerSingleton getInstance() { return instance; }`: This is a public static method named `getInstance()`, which provides access to the single instance of `EagerSingleton`. It simply returns the pre-initialized `instance` created during class loading.

### Additional Information

Eager Initialization ensures that the Singleton instance is available as soon as the class is loaded. This approach is suitable when you are certain that the Singleton instance will always be needed, and the overhead of creating the instance upfront is acceptable.

However, it's essential to be cautious with Eager Initialization in cases where the Singleton instance might not always be necessary, as it can lead to unnecessary resource consumption. In such scenarios, Lazy Initialization (creating the instance only when it's requested) might be a more efficient alternative.

Eager Initialization provides thread safety by default because the instance is created during class loading, and Java ensures that class loading is inherently thread-safe.
