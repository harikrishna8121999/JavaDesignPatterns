## Thread-Safe Singleton

### Explanation
Thread-Safe Singleton is a Singleton pattern implementation designed to be thread-safe, ensuring that multiple threads cannot create multiple instances of the Singleton class. It addresses the issue of concurrent access, making it safe for use in multi-threaded environments.

### Implementation

```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    // 1. Private static instance initially set to null.
    private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;

    // 2. Private constructor prevents external instantiation.
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {
        // Initialization code, if any.
    }

    // 3. Public synchronized method to provide access to the instance.
    public static synchronized ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        // 4. Check if the instance is null and create it if needed.
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Code Example and Explanation

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;`: This line declares a private static instance variable called `instance` and initializes it to `null`. Like lazy initialization, the instance is not created during class loading but remains null initially.

2. `private ThreadSafeSingleton() { /* Initialization code, if any. */ }`: This is the private constructor of the `ThreadSafeSingleton` class. It prevents external classes from creating new instances of `ThreadSafeSingleton`. You can include initialization code inside this constructor if needed.

3. `public static synchronized ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() { /* ... */ }`: This is a public static synchronized method named `getInstance()`, which provides access to the single instance of `ThreadSafeSingleton`. The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute this method at a time, preventing multiple instances from being created concurrently.

4. In this part of the code:
   ```java
   if (instance == null) {
       instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
   }
   ```
    - It checks if the `instance` is `null`. If it is, a new instance of `ThreadSafeSingleton` is created.
    - The synchronized method ensures that only one thread at a time can enter this block of code, preventing multiple instances from being created concurrently.

### Additional Information

Thread-Safe Singleton is designed for multi-threaded environments where concurrent access to the Singleton instance is possible. However, it's important to note that the synchronization in the `getInstance()` method can introduce performance overhead, as it ensures only one thread can access it at a time.

While Thread-Safe Singleton guarantees thread safety, it may not be the most efficient choice if high concurrency is required. In such cases, you might consider other thread-safe Singleton patterns or alternative design approaches that minimize synchronization.
